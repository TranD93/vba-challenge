# Stock Analysis
This analysis is using Visual Basic Application (VBA) that examines stock market information. Here's what it does:

It goes through a year's worth of stock data and collects important information from each row.

It creates columns for each stock, showing things like the stock symbol, how much it changed in a year (in dollars), what percentage that change is, and how much stock was traded.

It uses colors to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red in the columns.

It also figures out which stock had the biggest percentage increase, the biggest percentage decrease, and the highest trading volume for that year.

This program works in all the sheets of the workbook at once, and it automatically adjusts the cell sizes to make sure all the data fits nicely.
